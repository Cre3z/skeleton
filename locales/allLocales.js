        "intro-part-two": "In my free time, I study the Chinese language, and through this journey, I've developed a deep appreciation for Chinese culture and cuisine. Beef hot pot stands out as my favorite dish, and I'm thrilled to bring a taste of China to you.",

        "recipe-intro-one": "Learn how to make hot and numbing Sichuan style water boiled beef (Shui Zhu Niu Rou) at home. Sichuan style water boiled beef is one of my favorite dishes in restaurants. If you ever tasted it in China, you will crazily love the tenderness of the beef slices and shocked by how well they are flavored in the hot and red broth.",
        "recipe-intro-two": "“Water boiling” (水煮) is a unique cooking method originated in Sichuan cuisine. Of course, delicious beef slices cannot be achieved via “cooking in water”. The meat (fish, pork and beef) is well coated with a “protection shell” made from water and starch. This special layer of shell, on one hand, prevents the beef from being spoiled by the hot broth and on the other hand helps to keep the juice inside.",
        "recipe-intro-three": "Another surprise of the dish, in addition to the beef slice, is the vegetables at the bottom. They can absorb enough flavor form the broth, even though they are not boiled in the broth directly. Popular options about bottom vegetables are cabbage, bean sprouts, celery, mushrooms and lettuce head."
